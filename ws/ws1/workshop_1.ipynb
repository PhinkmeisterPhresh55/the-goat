    "# Introduction to the Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces Python, data analytics, and an online platform to practice them - Kaggle! We will go over the basics of data storage, manipulation, and visualization with Python. Then we will implement a statisical learning model to develop a classification predictor. To see how well our predictor performs, the answers from our predictor will be submitted to a Kaggle competition and scored. Links to more advanced data manipulation and analyses will be referenced thoroughout.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning:** Our goal is provide a starting point for Python data analytics, not to teach Python from the ground up or to address statistical learning at a detailed level. There will be references included for those who wants more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is to predict survival on the Titanic. We will attempt this by implementing a statistical learning method called the Naive Bayesian Classifier. To implement and train our classifier we use three Python packages: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit Learn. Numpy includes tools for linear algebra, statistical anlysis, and matrix manipulation. Pandas helps us store and manipulate data. Seaborn is used to visualize the data stored in Pandas. Finally, Scikit Learn includes the data analysis tools that we will use develop and train our predictive model.\n",
